ðŸ”¹ Description:
Simulated and validated real-world OAuth 2.0 and OIDC authentication flows to understand edge cases, improve security, and create reusable test templates. Focused on common vulnerabilities and token handling.

ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies:
Postman â€“ for testing OAuth endpoints and flows
Python â€“ scripted token handling and testing logic
OAuth 2.0 / OIDC â€“ core authentication protocols used
JWT (JSON Web Tokens) â€“ tested structure, expiry, and decoding
Google & GitHub APIs â€“ real-world OAuth providers
Burp Suite â€“ optional security analysis of flows
Security Headers â€“ verified CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.
CSRF Protection Testing â€“ simulated attack vectors

ðŸ“ˆ Key Outcomes:
Tested 10+ edge cases (e.g., expired tokens, scope mismatches, CSRF)
Identified and mitigated 5 security risks
Documentation rated 9/10 by peers for clarity and reusability
